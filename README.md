# Mahmudul Hasan (Tanmoy)
**Systems Engineer | Backend Architect | Autodidact**

Driven by the challenge of building resilient, high-concurrency systems. As a 14-year-old developer, I have bypassed traditional institutional paths—including high school—to pursue a rigorous, self-directed curriculum in Computer Science and Software Engineering.

### 📖 Educational Journey & Self-Direction
* **Formal Education:** None. I do not have a high school level or any formal institutional education.
* **The Autodidact Path:** Mastering Computer Science through documentation, technical whitepapers, and building production-grade applications.
* **Core Focus:** Currently deep-diving into Operating Systems, Networking (TCP/UDP), and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).

---

### 🚀 Research & Development
* **Current Focus:** Optimizing Go concurrency patterns (Goroutines & Channels) for scalable backend services.
* **Engineering Standard:** Firm believer in **Clean Code**, **SOLID principles**, and **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.
* **Goal:** Proving that high-level engineering mastery is achievable through discipline and passion, independent of traditional schooling.
